# **Predictors of clinical outcome in Glioblastoma: A meta-analysis of individual patient data** 
Links to data, supplementary material and data analysis pipeline 

Glioblastoma is the most aggressive brain tumor with a poor median survival of ~15months.  Several factors have been implicated in their role in treatment response and survival. Using a rigorous meta-analytic method, we investigated the determinants of survival in 14 separate GBM investigations. The research focuses on cohorts that include not only clinical data but also transcriptomics data from the related patient tumors. We only looked at primary GBMs, which are malignant tumors that started in the brain and didn't spread elsewhere. The biology of malignant brain tumors in children and adolescents (under the age of four years) might differ dramatically from that of adult-onset GBM patients. Overall, the current study looked at characteristics that influence prognosis in individuals with primary adult glioblastoma and each of these factors are discussed.
